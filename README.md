# Modal Windows
## In the example we have 3 modal windows, when a modal is clicked a window will open and display some text, the window can be closed by pressing "X" or "Esc".
## The purpose of this is to expand on DOM manipulation, it demonstrates how we can change a "display: hidden" value in CSS using Javascript, via variable.classlist.remove('hidden'). We can do this when the button is clicked to reveal the HTML text alongside its CSS class which is our modal window. I also added more event listeners with the aid of a for loop later so that when the escape button is pressed the class will be hidde again and therefore closes the window.
## It's a simple non-responsive JavaScript demonstration so it is unlikely to work well on smaller screens, it was built for a 1920 * 1080 resolution.
